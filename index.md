# About UH Stego 

UH students commonly send text messages to communicate, but sometimes SMS or instant chat is not secure enough. Truly sensitive data should be transported or hidden to ensure that it is not left exposed to nosey third parties.

Our application allows students hide sensitive text messages or images steganographically. These doctored images can be used a transport media to deliver messages without raising any suspicion or attracting unwanted attention. Once in the hands of the proper recipient, the hidden message can be extracted.

# Features
* Create a profile to send and receive messages.
* Find other users to send private messages.
* Encrypt a message using steganography.
* Decrypt an encrypted message that used steganography.
